# Server Side Rendering

## Server Side Rendering, also called SSR, is the ability of a JavaScript application to render on the server rather than in the browser.

## Why would we ever want to do so?

- ### It allows your site to have a faster first page load time, which is the key to a good user experience
- ### It is essential for SEO: search engines cannot (yet?) efficiently and correctly index applications that exclusively render client-side. Despite the latest improvements to indexing in Google, there are other search engines too, and Google is not perfect at it in any case. Also, Google favors sites with fast load times, and having to load client-side is not good for speed
- ### Itâ€™s great when people share a page of your site on social media, as they can easily gather the metadata needed to nicely share the link (images, title, description..)
